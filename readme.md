# cfn-changeset-viewer

This CLI will view the changes calculated in a CloudFormation ChangeSet in a more human-friendly way, including rendering details from a nested change set.

## Usage

```txt
cfn-changeset-viewer <options>
Options:
  --version                    Show version number [boolean]
  --change-set-name            The name, ARN, or file:// path of the change set [string]
  --stack-name                 The name of the stack, only required if the change set ARN is not specified [string]
  --no-color                   Disable color output [boolean] [default: false]
  --show-unchanged-properties  Show unchanged properties in the diff [boolean]
  --region                     The AWS region where the change-set is located [string]
  --help                       Show help [boolean]
```

## Display

Each changed resource will be printed to stdout.
If a resource is a nested stack, the nested stack's changeset will be printed as well, recursively.
`LogicalId`s of the event's resource for nested stacks will be rendered as `NestedStack/NestedResource`)
An icon showing what kind of change has been made (Add: `+`, Modify: `~`, Remove: `-`, Import: `â†“`, Dynamic: `?`)
A warning will be logged for resource changes that may result in a replacement.

## Example
